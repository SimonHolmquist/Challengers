## Project Overview

This API simulates tennis tournaments using direct elimination. Matches are calculated based on player attributes and random luck. The system includes:

- Male and female tournament simulation logic
- Domain-driven modeling and layered architecture
- REST API with filtering and pagination
- JWT-based authentication for admin-only operations
- Multilanguage support via `.resx` and headers
- Integration with Docker and SQL Server
- Unit and integration tests

---

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture and separation of concerns across multiple layers:

- Domain: core entities, value objects, business logic
- Application: CQRS handlers, validation, DTOs
- Infrastructure: database access (EF Core), JWT, DI
- API: ASP.NET Core REST endpoints, authentication, Swagger
